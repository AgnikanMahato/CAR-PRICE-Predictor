# Car Price Prediction Model üöó

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a **Car Price Prediction Model** using machine learning techniques. The objective is to predict the price of a used car based on multiple factors such as the year of manufacture, mileage, brand, and more. This project aims to provide an accurate and efficient model that can help buyers and sellers make informed decisions in the used car market.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, performed feature scaling, and prepared the dataset for machine learning.
- **Feature Engineering**: Analyzed key factors that influence car prices, such as the year of production, engine capacity, fuel type, mileage, and brand reputation.
- **Model Selection**: Applied different machine learning algorithms including:
  - **Linear Regression**
  - **Random Forest Regression**
  - **Decision Tree Regression**
  - **XGBoost**
- **Model Evaluation**: Used metrics like **R¬≤ score**, **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** to evaluate model performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimized the models through grid search and cross-validation techniques to improve accuracy.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python üêç
- **Libraries Used**:
  - **Pandas** for data manipulation
  - **NumPy** for numerical computations
  - **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
  - **Scikit-learn** for model building
  - **XGBoost** for advanced gradient boosting models
- **Data Source**: Car dataset containing detailed information on various vehicles

## Data Analysis Process

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized relationships between car features and their respective prices.
   - Uncovered key patterns like how mileage, brand, and manufacturing year affect car prices.
  
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Dealt with missing values by applying mean/median imputation.
   - Scaled continuous features to ensure all variables are on the same scale.
   - Performed encoding on categorical variables (e.g., car brands, fuel types).

3. **Modeling and Training**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80/20 ratio).
   - Applied different machine learning models and tested their performance on unseen data.
   - Fine-tuned model parameters using grid search and cross-validation.

4. **Evaluation and Results**:
   - The best-performing model was selected based on its R¬≤ score and error metrics.
   - Visualized the model‚Äôs predictions against actual values to understand its accuracy.

## Project Results

The model was able to predict car prices with a reasonable degree of accuracy, particularly when using advanced models like **XGBoost**. With hyperparameter tuning, the **R¬≤ score** improved, and the overall prediction errors were minimized.

## Future Work

- Implementing more complex models such as **Deep Learning** to improve prediction accuracy.
- Adding more features (e.g., car condition, region) to improve the robustness of the model.
- Deploying the model using **Flask** or **Streamlit** for real-time car price predictions.

## Conclusion

This project provided valuable insights into how various factors impact car prices. By using advanced machine learning techniques, we were able to build a model that predicts used car prices with a good level of accuracy. It serves as a useful tool for those looking to buy or sell cars, offering data-driven insights into pricing decisions.
